# General goals

* Implement Sliding Window to use own NN
* Implement Andreas Dataset for RNN and LSTM
* Implement Layer Normalization for better result
* Implement 1D convolution of data to move further backwards in time
* Remove trend and seasonality

# Theory

* RNNs -> LSTMs
* Sliding Window
* Time Series Data
* ENTSO data

## Extra

* NVE dataset
